How It Works
Initialization:

All modules are initialized in the setup() function.
The LCD displays a startup message and then real-time data.
Lighting:

Lights automatically turn on/off based on motion detection and ambient light levels.
RGB LEDs change color depending on the temperature.
Security:

PIR, door, and window sensors detect unauthorized activity.
Gas and smoke sensors trigger alarms and activate fans.
Environment:

Sensors monitor temperature, humidity, rain, and air quality.
Servo motor-controlled curtains adjust based on rain or sunlight.
User Control:

Real-time updates on the LCD.
Manual override via IR remote or Bluetooth module.
Software Setup
Install Arduino IDE.
Add the required libraries:
DHT for temperature and humidity.
LiquidCrystal_I2C for the LCD display.
Servo for motor control.
Upload the provided code to the Arduino Mega.
Wiring and Pin Mapping
Each module is connected to a specific pin on the Arduino Mega. Refer to the code comments for exact pin assignments. Use a breadboard and jumper wires for initial testing and a PCB for final deployment.

Future Enhancements
Integration with a mobile app via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
Advanced analytics using an SD card module for data logging.
Voice control compatibility using Google Assistant or Alexa.
